Welcome to my GitHub repository created as part of my internship at CODSOFT. This repository contains a collection of three Python projects that showcase fundamental programming concepts and problem-solving skills. Below is a brief overview of each project.

Projects
1. Calculator
A simple command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator provides a user-friendly interface, allowing users to input expressions and receive results instantly.

Features:

Supports basic arithmetic operations.
Handles errors gracefully (e.g., division by zero).
User-friendly input and output format.
2. Password Generator
A secure password generator that creates random passwords based on user-defined criteria, such as length and character types (e.g., letters, numbers, special characters). This project demonstrates the use of randomization and string manipulation in Python.

Features:

Customizable password length.
Option to include/exclude different character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).
Ensures strong, unpredictable passwords.
3. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
A simple command-line game where the user can play rock, paper, scissors against the computer. The game follows standard rules and keeps track of scores.

Features:

User vs. Computer gameplay.
Randomized computer moves.
Keeps track of wins, losses, and ties.
